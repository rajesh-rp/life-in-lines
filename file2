Every thing in your life that may be your study that 
may be your work that may be your relationship 
if we thought every thing as a game then we can understand 
everything better.in every aspect of our life we will face 
victory and we will face lose we will get happiness and we will get sorrow ness
but everytime we learn we experience new thing and 
we should continue everything we should grow no matter what 
we will move foreward we will keep going and one day will come
when we will understand why we need to face those things in our life.
so keep going keep smiling keep hunting for the good that is happening with you 
that may be a small thing but keep hunting keep growing.
